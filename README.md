## What I Learned

During this project, I improved my skills in:

- Managing component state with React (`useState`)
- Handling hover/active styles with inline dynamic styles
- Implementing a responsive design workflow (mobile-first approach)
- Creating a lightbox gallery and managing active thumbnails
- Cart logic (add, remove, quantity update)

## Future Improvements

- Add a checkout page and order summary
- Implement local storage for persistent cart
- Add animations for transitions (e.g., opening/closing cart, mobile menu)
- Improve accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
